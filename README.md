# OpenCodeDev.NetCMS.Compiler
Official Compiler for NetCMS using Roslyn Source Code Generator.

## Overview
This project is a compiler for NetCMS, we wanted to test Source Code Generator from Microsoft.

This project is quite messy, lots of testing around lots of antipatterns, we will probably clean it up someday but so far our focus is to harmonize the Compiler, Admin, Server and Shared Resources to allow Api Generator using full cutting edge technologies.

Everyone is welcome to contribute thru PRs
